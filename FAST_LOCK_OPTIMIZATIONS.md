# Fast Lock Optimizations for Boundless Prover

This document describes the optimizations made to the Boundless prover to lock orders faster than other provers.

## Overview

The optimizations focus on reducing latency at every step of the order processing pipeline:

1. **Order Detection** - Faster WebSocket and event stream processing
2. **Order Evaluation** - Aggressive preflight skipping for high-value orders
3. **Order Processing** - Increased parallelism and reduced timeouts
4. **Network Communication** - Optimized RPC and WebSocket settings

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Fast Order Evaluation (`order_picker.rs`)

**Fast Lock Threshold**: Orders with value ≥ 0.01 ETH are locked immediately without preflight execution.

**Fast Lock Criteria**:
- Order value ≥ 0.01 ETH
- Lock stake < 100 tokens
- Sufficient time to prove (≥ 5 minutes)
- Available gas and stake balance

**Benefits**:
- Reduces latency by 2-5 seconds per high-value order
- Bypasses expensive preflight execution
- Uses conservative cycle estimates

### 2. Increased Processing Capacity

**Concurrent Preflights**: Increased from default 10 to 30 (3x increase)

**Processing Throughput**: 
- Process up to 2x more orders per iteration
- Use `spawn_blocking` for CPU-intensive preflight work
- Prioritize high-value orders in processing queue

### 3. Optimized Order Detection

**WebSocket Optimizations**:
- Reduced ping interval from 30s to 10s
- Pre-allocated message buffers
- Biased select for message processing priority

**Event Stream Optimizations**:
- Batch order sending (up to 5 orders per batch)
- Immediate sending for high-value orders
- Pre-allocated order buffers

### 4. Reduced Timeouts and Retries

**Prover Settings**:
- Reduced retry counts for faster failure detection
- Reduced sleep intervals between retries
- Faster status polling (500ms vs default)

**RPC Settings**:
- Reduced retry counts and backoff times
- Faster gas price polling (1s vs default)
- Reduced chain monitoring intervals

## Configuration

Use the `broker-fast-lock.toml` configuration file which includes:

```toml
[market]
max_concurrent_preflights = 30
min_deadline = 60
fast_lock_threshold_eth = 0.01
fast_lock_max_cycles = 1000000
fast_lock_max_stake = 100

[prover]
req_retry_count = 2
req_retry_sleep_ms = 100
status_poll_ms = 500
```

## Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for optimal performance:

```bash
# Reduce WebSocket ping interval
export ORDER_STREAM_CLIENT_PING_MS=10000

# Increase RPC timeout
export RPC_TIMEOUT=5000

# Enable fast lock mode
export FAST_LOCK_MODE=true
```

## Performance Expectations

With these optimizations, you should see:

- **2-5 second latency reduction** for high-value orders (≥0.01 ETH)
- **3x increase** in concurrent order processing
- **Faster failure detection** and recovery
- **Better connection stability** with reduced ping intervals

## Trade-offs

**Risk Considerations**:
- Fast lock orders use conservative cycle estimates
- Reduced retry counts may miss some recoverable errors
- Higher concurrent processing may increase resource usage

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Fast lock only applies to low-complexity, high-value orders
- Conservative cycle estimates prevent over-commitment
- Monitoring and alerting for failed orders

## Monitoring

Monitor these metrics to ensure optimal performance:

- Order lock success rate
- Average order processing time
- Preflight execution time
- WebSocket connection stability
- RPC response times

## Usage

1. Copy `broker-fast-lock.toml` to your broker configuration
2. Set the recommended environment variables
3. Restart your broker with the new configuration
4. Monitor performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

**High Order Lock Failures**:
- Check gas and stake balances
- Verify RPC endpoint performance
- Review order complexity thresholds

**Connection Issues**:
- Verify WebSocket endpoint stability
- Check network latency to order stream
- Review ping/pong timing

**Performance Degradation**:
- Monitor system resources (CPU, memory)
- Check concurrent preflight limits
- Review RPC rate limits
